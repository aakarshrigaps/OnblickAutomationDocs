# MaildropPage

The `MaildropPage` class contains all the locators and methods necessary to interact with the Maildrop page of the application. This was created when we couldn't find an alternative for mailinator when it wasn't working but then we found [`Alternative Mailinator Domains`](./mailinator-page.md/#getrandommailinatordomain) so this class isn't used as of now.

## Members

The locators used in the `MaildropPage` class aren't disclosed here, you can go through the `MaildropPage.cs` file in the project to view the locators. All locator members are of two types `By` and `IWebElement`(using `PageObjectFactory`).
