# MailhogPage

The `MailhogPage` class contains all the locators and methods necessary to interact with the Mailhog page. Mailhog is an email testing tool for developers. It captures all the emails sent from the application and displays them in a web interface. The `MailhogPage` class is used to interact with the Mailhog web interface to verify that emails are being sent correctly. As the UI can take some time to load, the [`GetShowHeaders`](#getshowheaders) and [`GetHideHeaders`](#gethideheaders) methods are used after opening a mail to ensure that the mail body is loaded before proceeding with further actions.
