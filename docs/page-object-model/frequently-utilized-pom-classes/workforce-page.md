# WorkforcePage

The `WorkforcePage` class contains all the enums, locators and methods necessary to interact with the Workforce page of the application. The Workforce page is used to manage the workforce of an organization, including adding, editing, and deleting employees.

## Members

### **Enums**

---

The `WorkforcePage` class contains the following enums:

#### EmployeeType [:octicons-sliders-24:](../../getting-started/conventions.md/#enum)

The `EmployeeType` enumeration represents different states or categories of an employee within the system. This enum is used to classify and manage employees based on their current employment status.

=== "Enum Members"

	| Member | Description |
	| ------ | ----------- |
	| [:octicons-goal-24:](../../getting-started/conventions.md/#default)`Active` | Represents an active employee. |
	| `NewHire` | Represents a new hire employee. |
	| `Terminated` | Represents a terminated employee. |

=== "Usage"

	This enum is used in multiple workforce methods to classify employees based on their current status.

	```csharp
	EmployeeType employeeType1 = EmployeeType.Active;
	EmployeeType employeeType2 = EmployeeType.NewHire;
	EmployeeType employeeType3 = EmployeeType.Terminated;
	```

### **Locators**

---

The locators used in the `WorkforcePage` class aren't disclosed here, you can go through the `WorkforcePage.cs` file in the project to view the locators. All locator members are of two types `By` and `IWebElement`(using `PageObjectFactory`).

### **Methods**

---

The `WorkforcePage` class contains several methods that are used to interact with the Workforce page. Some of the methods are private and some are public, italicized methods are private methods.

#### SearchEmployee [:octicons-globe-24:](../../getting-started/conventions.md/#public)
