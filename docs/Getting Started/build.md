# Building the Solution

Building the solution is an essential step to ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed and the project is ready for execution. Follow the steps below to build the solution for your Selenium C# automation project.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### **Open the Solution in Visual Studio**

---

- Open Visual Studio 2022.
- Navigate to the project directory and open the solution file (`.sln`).

### **Restore NuGet Packages**

---

To restore the necessary NuGet packages:

- In Visual Studio, go to `Tools` > `NuGet Package Manager` > `Package Manager Console`.
- Run the following command:
	```bash
	dotnet restore
	```
- This command will install and restore all the NuGet packages required for the project.
- You can also right-click on the solution in the Solution Explorer and select `Restore NuGet Packages`.

### **Build the Solution**

---

To build the solution:

- Click on `Build` in the Visual Studio menu.
- Select `Build Solution` from the dropdown menu.
- Alternatively, you can use the shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + B` to build the solution or use the `dotnet build` command in the terminal.
- Visual Studio will compile the project and display any build errors or warnings in the `Error List` window.
- Ensure that the build is successful without any errors.

### **Verify the Build Output**

---

After building the solution, verify the build output:

- Check the `Output` window in Visual Studio for the build output.
- Ensure that the build succeeded and there are no errors or warnings.
- The build output will show the build time, number of errors, warnings, and other relevant information.
- If there are any errors, review the error messages and resolve them before proceeding.
- If the build is successful, the project is ready for execution.

### **Conclusion**

---

Building the solution ensures that all dependencies are correctly installed, and the project is compiled without any errors. This step is crucial before running your Selenium C# automation tests to ensure that the project is in a stable state and ready for execution.

_Note: If you're ever pushing your code to remote, make sure there are no errors by building the solution first._
